-- Cross-currency voucher linking: settle a SEK-booked payment voucher against
-- a foreign-currency invoice by booking the FX residual to 7960/3960, instead
-- of refusing with LINK_VOUCHER_CURRENCY_MISMATCH / LINK_SI_VOUCHER_CURRENCY_MISMATCH.
--
-- THE GAP: 20260726140000 taught both link RPCs to resolve the matched amount
-- in the INVOICE's currency. On a foreign invoice the only readable column is
-- `amount_in_currency` on lines labelled with that currency; any matched-side
-- line without such a figure made the voucher UNREADABLE and the RPC failed
-- closed. That is the right call for a line stamped with a THIRD currency,
-- but it also rejected the most common real-world shape: a EUR invoice whose
-- receivable was booked in kronor on 1510 (SIE import, manual voucher, older
-- engine output) and whose payment voucher is plain SEK with no currency
-- metadata at all. Such an invoice could not be settled by any API path.
--
-- THE FIX ports the cross-currency settlement that match_batch_allocate
-- (20260824120000) already performs, with the SAME sign conventions:
--
--   v_fx_diff = booked_sek - settled_sek, both rounded to the öre, where
--   booked_sek = ROUND(remaining * invoices.exchange_rate * 100) / 100 and
--   settled_sek is the voucher's matched-side SEK ledger sum.
--
--   Customer:  diff > 0 (received less than booked)  -> Dr 7960 Valutakursförlust
--              diff < 0 (received more than booked)  -> Cr 3960 Valutakursvinst
--   Supplier:  diff > 0 (paid less than booked)      -> Cr 3960 Valutakursvinst
--              diff < 0 (paid more than booked)      -> Dr 7960 Valutakursförlust
--
-- One structural difference from match_batch_allocate: that RPC CREATES its
-- settlement verifikat, so the residual line lives inside it. The link RPCs
-- link an EXISTING posted voucher, which is immutable (BFL 5 kap 5 §,
-- enforcement triggers from migration 017). The residual is therefore booked
-- as its OWN two-line SEK verifikat (committed atomically through
-- commit_journal_entry, so voucher numbering stays sequential), with the
-- AR/AP counter-leg on the same account the voucher settled. Combined,
-- invoice entry + payment voucher + residual verifikat net the receivable /
-- payable to exactly zero: identical ledger effect to the single verifikat
-- match_batch_allocate books. The residual is öre-rounded on both inputs, so
-- it is either exactly 0.00 (no verifikat needed) or >= 0.01 (a balanced
-- debit/credit pair, both sides > 0).
--
-- The fallback engages ONLY when every part of the case is unambiguous:
--   * the invoice is foreign (resolved currency <> 'SEK');
--   * NO matched-side line carries a readable figure in the invoice currency
--     (a mixed voucher stays fail-closed: summing units would be guesswork);
--   * every unreadable matched-side line is genuinely SEK-booked, i.e. its
--     label is 'SEK' or NULL. A line labelled with the invoice's currency but
--     missing amount_in_currency is malformed metadata (buildCurrencyMetadata
--     stamps label and figure together), and a third-currency label is a
--     counterparty discriminator: both keep today's mismatch error;
--   * customer side: accounting method is accrual. On kontantmetoden no
--     receivable was ever booked, so there is no residual to true up and no
--     account to book it against;
--   * invoices/supplier_invoices.exchange_rate is present and sane (same
--     bounds as match_batch_allocate: > 0, < 100000);
--   * the voucher's SEK total is within 10% of booked_sek (same deviation
--     band as match_batch_allocate). The voucher is then read as settling the
--     FULL remaining, exactly as match_batch_allocate treats cross-currency
--     allocations; a partial SEK settlement of a foreign invoice falls
--     outside the band and stays fail-closed.
--
-- Every fail-closed branch keeps the existing CURRENCY_MISMATCH codes (with a
-- `reason` in details for diagnosability), so no TS error mapping changes and
-- callers see the same stable codes as before.
--
-- The payment row records the FULL remaining in the invoice's currency plus
-- payment_exchange_rate = settled_sek / remaining (round-6), mirroring
-- match_batch_allocate's traceability convention. The residual verifikat is
-- created only AFTER the already-linked guard, and the whole RPC body is one
-- transaction: a later failure rolls the verifikat back.
--
-- Everything else in both bodies is verbatim from 20260801204551
-- (UTC-noon paid_at projection + NULL-safe caller_is_company_member guard).
